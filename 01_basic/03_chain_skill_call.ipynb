      "00:38\t And in this time, we are going to show how you can clone and interact with your repository using an SSH key.\n",
      "00:46\t This is not a new thing in Git and if you are a long-term Git user,\n",
      "00:51\t you can remember when at the very first days of GitHub, you usually will access your\n",

      "01:12\t this nice https.github.com blah blah blah or that you can use directly with your git clone command.\n",
      "01:21\t But if you press SSH, you can look at a new way of\n",
      "01:26\t cloning and interacting with your GitHub repository and the URL of the repository is different. It starts with git at\n",
      "01:33\t github.com and\n",
      "01:35\t this type of access is made with the SSH protocol and it is\n",
      "01:42\t especially useful if you are using your\n",
      "01:46\t repository in a shared computer or in a computer that is not fully secure.\n",
      "01:52\t Remember when you clone or interact with the repository in GitHub,\n",

      "02:27\t So, let's see how SSH is different.\n",

      "03:18\t hardware key. You can press this, you can press OK to authorize the access to your key. You can\n",
      "03:25\t type your PIN, press button and\n",
      "03:29\t then it asks you the name of the key. You can left the default one and you can choose a passphrase.\n",
      "03:35\t So the passphrase is usually used to\n",
      "03:39\t encrypt your private key and in case of a\n",
      "03:42\t key stored inside your physical YubiKey, you can even go passwordless because\n",
      "03:48\t actually the real key is stored inside your YubiKey.\n",
      "03:53\t So you can even choose not to give a password. In this situation, I've given a\n",
      "03:58\t really simple password just to show you how you can use the default option.\n",
      "04:04\t Now inside your home folder, a folder called\n",

      "04:26\t just to confirm to tell GitHub that this public key correspond to a private key you have access to and\n",
      "04:34\t this can verify your identity.\n",
      "04:36\t You can just copy all the text of your public key.\n",
      "04:41\t Remember the public key is the file that ends with .pub.\n",
      "04:45\t You can go to the setting of your account and if you scroll down you have a section called\n",

      "05:06\t I'm pressing the, I'm just pasting the content of the public key.\n",
      "05:12\t So the key type is authentication key or sign in key.\n",

      "06:14\t if you recognize the authenticity of GitHub and this show you the first reason why\n",
      "06:22\t SSH is more secure than HTTPS protocol. As you can see if you take the fingerprint of the key this\n",
      "06:30\t SSH 256 plus DI blah blah blah blah and you search in the internet or you know the URL where GitHub published\n",
      "06:37\t their public key, you can see that indeed\n",
      "06:41\t this key matched. So this is important because it gives you the\n",
      "06:48\t 100%\n",
      "06:49\t confirmation that the other part of the party is GitHub and no one is\n",
      "06:53\t intercepting your traffic with a man in the middle because if someone\n",
      "06:58\t hijack your DNS and trick you into connecting its own server,\n",

      "07:11\t it means that they have private corresponding private key.\n",
      "07:14\t So the first advantage of connecting with SSH protocol is mutual authentication.\n",
      "07:20\t GitHub will know who you are, but you are sure that the other part is really and indeed GitHub.\n",
      "07:26\t Since I verify that the fingerprint is okay, I can tell yes\n",

      "07:40\t touch my key and my presence is confirmed.\n",
      "07:43\t So the good part is I was able to verify that\n",
      "07:47\t GitHub is indeed GitHub and GitHub verified that I have my private key inside my YubiKey. Now\n",
      "07:53\t the question is why you want to use SSH in\n",
      "07:58\t 2023\n",
      "07:59\t for your GitHub repositories? Well, first of all, you have multiple authentication.\n",
      "08:04\t SSH protocol really gives you the ability to verify that the other part is really GitHub.\n",
      "08:10\t So you are sending your code somewhere and you want to be sure that when you push your code or pull your code,\n",
      "08:16\t the code really comes from GitHub and SSH protocol is an industry standard secure protocol that can give you\n",
      "08:23\t this certainty. 100% you are secure, you're connecting to GitHub upon verification of the public key.\n",
      "08:30\t The second advantage is when you use a computer that is used by many person or that cannot be\n",
      "08:38\t completely secure because when you use an SSH key stored inside your physical YubiKey to\n",
      "08:44\t actually use the SSH protocol, you need to have physically your YubiKey in your hand and connected to your computer.\n",
      "08:51\t So even if you are using a shared computer,\n",
      "08:54\t even if you forget to delete your private and public key from the computer before leaving,\n",
      "09:00\t those files are not useful, cannot be used without your physical key. So you can choose\n",
      "09:08\t not super hard to\n",
