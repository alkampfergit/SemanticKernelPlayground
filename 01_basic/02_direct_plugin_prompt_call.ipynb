    "00:00\t Hi and welcome again to a new video about Ubiki, in which I deal with a question I got quite often\n",
    "00:09\t and the question is why I cannot use advanced shared features like SSHK stored in my Ubiki\n",
    "00:17\t when I work in Windows, it seems not supported.\n",
    "00:20\t So what is the problem?\n",
    "00:22\t This problem usually does not happen in Linux because Linux notively has support for SSH.\n",
    "00:28\t So when you update your Linux machine, usually you will receive the latest version of the\n",
    "00:34\t Open SSH protocol that supports Ubiki and you have no problem.\n",
    "00:40\t In Windows, the situation is little different.\n",
    "00:43\t Let me show you why.\n",
    "00:45\t In the vast majority of situations, the problem is not having the latest version of SSH.\n",
    "00:51\t And to verify this, open a Windows terminal and type SSH, sorry, SSH-capital day.\n",
    "00:59\t And if you did not ever install or upgrade SSH, this is the answer.\n",
    "01:06\t The answer is open SSH for Windows 8.6 and this is indeed too old to support your Ubiki.\n",
    "01:15\t Now the usual follow-up question is, I keep my Windows up to date, I install all the\n",
    "01:21\t operating system update.\n",
    "01:22\t If you need the open SSH part of the operating system, so it's supposed to be update with\n",
    "01:28\t the standard Windows update program, the answer is no.\n",
    "01:35\t If you go on the GitHub repository of PowerShell, we in 32 open SSH, you can already see that\n",
    "01:42\t the release shows you that the latest version is indeed the 9.4 and it is really, really\n",
    "01:49\t much more recent than the 8.6.\n",
    "01:52\t So why it is not automatically updated?\n",
    "01:57\t And the answer is because Microsoft changed it how it supports SSH, so you now need to\n",
    "02:03\t install the open SSH package separately as another as you install other software in Windows.\n",
    "02:11\t It's really supported by Microsoft, but it's not part of the standard update cycle of\n",
    "02:16\t the operating system.\n",
    "02:18\t The solution is really, really simple.\n",
    "02:21\t You just open the terminal and you can use Wingat, new Windows package manager to find\n",
    "02:28\t the package that contains the latest version.\n",
    "02:30\t So you can search open SSH and look at the supported, sorry, it's the Wingat search, open\n",
    "02:38\t SSH and it will tell you that there is open SSH beta Microsoft open SSH.beta and even if\n",
    "02:45\t it's a beta version, it's fully supported and it works perfectly and it should be the\n",
    "02:49\t version that you are going to install.\n",
    "02:52\t So you can simply Wingat install Microsoft open SSH and letting Wingat, sorry, beta and\n",
    "03:01\t letting Wingat install everything for you.\n",
    "03:04\t So you just wait a little bit for the package to be installed and then you will verify if\n",
    "03:10\t the new version of SSH is indeed installed.\n",
    "03:15\t If you type SSH-capital v again to verify the version, you can verify that now you have\n",
    "03:24\t not anymore the 8.6 version, but you now have the Windows 9.4 version that is updated\n",
    "03:31\t and it fully supports your Ubiki.\n",
    "03:33\t So before starting using SSH functionalities on Windows, please just be sure you updated\n",
    "03:41\t the SSH protocol, the open SSH protocol to the latest version and thanks to Wingat, it\n",
    "03:48\t is just a one-line install instruction.\n",
    "03:53\t And this concludes this video.\n",
